VREI
Week 1

Each team will have a “Design Journal” in which they document their
validation and decision process at every step, focusing on their processes. This Journal will be submitted with reports, presentations, prototypes, etc. as outlined in the assignments descriptions below

Wrote story map.

Week 2
9/6/18

No playgrounds
Food allergies
Containers and tents
H20 availability
Food lines (stressful)
Access to medicine
Back home, have degrees
Host countries, they are removed to just being translators (credentials ignored)
Asad’s “KOOSH” -> 10,000 Syrian children
Alcohol and drugs in the camps (not huge problem) (18-29)
-> Weed, Opium from Afghanistan (Greek-grown drug rings)
Distrust of organization (doctors, etc.)
Misinformation
No privacy for women
Boys sexual exploitation
Rivalries between ethnic groups inside camp
Sectarianism
Potential facades (not sure if they being truthful or putting up a front)
Not expressive, fearful — cultural differences Germans: expectations of refugees (not on time)

1) 5 Levels of listening
￼
1. Ignoring
2. Pretend — Patronizing
3. Attentive — hearing both sides
4. Selective — Only hearing what you want to hear
5. Feeling what other people are feeling


2) Focusing on end products
Design sprint — planning out things

Identify what the measures of success will be
Ex. repeatability, user acceptance, longevity, affordability, etc.
If you were to build a product, what do you want it to be?

SMART acronym —  specific, measurability, achievable/actionable, relevant, time-bound

Our team ideas

Voted on metrics of success
￼

Come up with potential solution/products (what do these people need)
* Sustainability
* Affordability
* Desirability

Generate as many ideas as possible

Need good metrics (use your research to define them, it’s your North Star)

Ideation

Uploading photos to Google Drive, document every day

Recognizing gaps in our knowledge, we need to make sure we’re right/wrong

Final points:
Metric
Opening yourself to as many ideas as possible

We pivoted idea from diva cups/disks to hydrophobic wash cloth based on cultural differences.


Week 3

Designer for Refugee came in to talk

Product Design (career)

There’s not one way to make it

Own your own tangled path of life

Arts Center (in Pasadena)
art + design+photography college
Transportation design

(One) Design Thinking Process Model
Discover -> Define -> Develop -> Deliver
The double diamond (after how it looks)
Think more generally, then drill it down
Divergent phase, then convergent phase


Prompt = finding the right problem
Problem = setting the right criteria
Solution = finalized solution

Night loo (prevent rape at communal bathrooms)

Prompt = People affected by hardship
Research (what is problem you want to solve for)
Displaced person = sexual-based violence against women

Putting myself in the shoes of women, what are the problems being faced

Sources: UNHCR reports (related to women and violence), International Rescue Committee, Amnesty International

What number do you need to see to believe sexual assault is going on? (don’t need hard qualitative data as proof)

It’s the numbers that matter -> comes to -> It’s the stories that matter

User/Market Research
* Current solutions
    * Adult diapers (it was so degrading)
* Existing products
    * See what’s in the market

What Ifs
Ideation phase (Strategies to draw insights from)
Blue sky ideation phase (sketching out as many ideas as possible for these situations)
Quantity is key (most ideas get them out, most will be crap)
Question everything (reframe the problem)
Don’t hold tight to something was a great idea -> won’t iterate as much, won’t evolve
(Look to nature for inspiration — pricks from , squid from octopus)
(100 ideas are good = hard to choose)

Cultural sensitivity
Find secondary sources (e.g. from people who work with them)
The critique: don’t take it personally, take it and run with it.

bringing 20 ideas easier than 3 good ideas (worry too much if it’s a good idea)

Testing materials (see what is water absorbent, is it sticky on fingers)
(from 20 types of materials to 8) (bulgar wheat)

Speed, odor, ease of cleanup (3 criteria)


User journey with the container (you have to carry it, clean it, etc.)
(8 panels: 4 at night, 4 during day)

What did I learn?
Embrace what makes you unique
listen to your heart
listen to critiques (to make your project better)
when you’re stuck, make something.
take breaks.
fail fast and fail often.
trust the process.

1. Design Thinking
2. Problems
3. Ideation
4. Committees

Design Thinking Process Model
* Iterate quickly, arrive at a set of possible set of solutions. Failure is a purposeful option
* It isn’t solving an equation, where there’s a definitive answer for x
* Convincing yourself, making a hypothesis where you say “i think this is the correct path based on my research”
* Thickness of triangle == increased level of ambiguity
* Hourglass design process, constrain once when defining your problem, and again when you prototype/test your product

It’s hard for me because everything is new, I have to rethink my entire process. I like to build first, see the demand later.
However, it doesn’t work like that all the time.
“It drives engineers crazy”, because we are flipping the process
Be willing to take risks in the design process, not so attached to it (attach fixation)
Design Council UK
Design Thinking is not a Straight Line (Seems more circular).

How do you separate solutions from problems (You don’t you jump between both)
Problem definition and solution
Need a consensus on how to define the problem (needs short and simplistic)
Don’t fall in love with your idea (confirmation bias)

Brad sees every day in design world is ego driven, it’s not about right answer, it’s about my design is the best
Nobody wants to collaborate b/c they believe their idea is the right one

Methods of ideation (don’t reinvent the wheel)
You can steal ideas in a design studio
Design is always relative to other design
Do something new or do something better

SWOT analysis of existing product, how can we improve upon it

Can be ego driven, but use your collaborators as foil

Volunteer lawyers having issues due to political/structural issues, policies kept changing, there was no communication
Rejected applications with no idea why (our policies changed two weeks ago)


Ideation Techniques
The purpose of ideation techniques is to develop techniques to broaden your abilities to generate good ideas.
This is something that is focused little in CS and Engineers as a whole.
It is always build first, and break things along the way. (As FB says, move fast and break things).

Hard to build momentum, comfortable to generate shit ideas. Just to get the engine running.
Then the good ideas will start coming.
The perfect idea doesn’t come quickly.

If you don’t know too much about a topic, it’s a more effective process (fresh new ideas)
Design consultants — no preconception about a company, learn a lot, bring ideas that are fresh (company does same thing)

Diagramming / Sketching

brainstorming = Post-it notes, generate ideas
Worst Possible Idea

Mood boards, you’re literally just finding imagery that interests you, and then pin them all up to stimulate your mind
Mindmapping — popular


9/28 Ideation Ideas
Waterproofing and sealant using sprays (tent material)
Prevent rain damage and weather proof
Reuse life vests as

How to make throwing away trash more convenient than not throwing it away
Trash chutes that carry the trash away (tube, conveyer belt, air tube)

Create WALL-E boxes of trash as building material
Build mattresses from life vests
World market (sell the trash by reusing them as products)
Change the perception of trash from useless to something
Alarm in the tents (chance of false alarms)
Break windows of containers

Main Q’s
* Do research on existing products in the market
* What products that address our problems already exist
* Apply beyond Europe


10/4/18
$6000 prototyping
$1000 refugee maintenance cost
Don’t write actually monetary amount (implicated)

ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING MIN FAMILY CHALLENGE
We will have a total of 30K from the Min Family Challenge. This means each team will receive 6K (2K for Fall semester and 4K for Spring semester). We know this might not be enough for prototyping and testing but we hope with our combined efforts for fundraising, we will top off this initial seed funding.

We all talked about what specific issues we want to solve
E.g. economic cards,

SWOT Analysis
Score your criteria with weight values (aerodynamic vs. weight)

Skype talk with David’s colleague Omar
* We forget about the humanity, too focused on the politics
* How did cities get out of conflict after wars, the rebuilding successes and failures
* Forget about human face struggle of people going through crises
* Don’t hear about people, what are their coping mechanisms
* Refugee camps are transition point, they came from somewhere (not nowhere)
    * Highly rich, educated, just the case that they faced crisis
    * And everyone looks the same
* How to keep people at centre of reconstruction of communities / cities
    * Local community engagement
    * Brainstorming sessions with people affected by the situation
    * Keep people who are affected at the forefront of negotiations
* Architecture for social justice and social meaning
    * Not about materials, but about the purpose for the people
* Move away from monuments, more towards what people remember before the war
* Mapping the memories of people (what matters in people)
    * Rebuild everything what people remember about the community
* How to instill a feeling of home in refugee camps
    * A book: Destruction of home (Domicide)
    * Add paintings, build fountains reminiscent of home in Damascus, etc.
    * Home decorations
* Mail of the Ones in Exile
    * No DHL in Syria, send money to someone in Germany, send that money in Syria, then they buy it and send it to families


10/5/18
Men’s shoes are in shortage


10/11/18
How to evaluate ideas?
By next week: 3 products, benchmark them to existing products in the market

How to select ideas?
* Most interesting to you (high engagement but not most valuable)
* Ask experts (can be stakeholders)
* Most valuable to end-users/customers (ppl don’t know what they want but refugees might know; interviews, crowdsourcing, co-creation)
    * NGOs are customers, refugees are end-users
* Voting (internal and external)

Idea Selection Criteria
* Does it fit people’s needs
* Does it add value / is it different enough?
* Is technology available?
* Does it meet requirements in our problem statement?

Research Cube (Durability, Usability, Cost)
* Three axes, mapping ideas from easy (0) to hard (max) to achieve

User Research
* Who is the user? What is their age, gender, housing situation, resources
* Why do they need this product
* How to discover it
* How will they use it
* How many potential customers are there

User Journey, User Personas
* Demonstrate the way users are/could interact with the product
* A persona is based on user research with goals, behaviours, and patterns

Benchmarking
* SWOT existing solutions
    * What works/doesn’t
* SWOT your solution
    * Challenges/why is your solution better

Weighted Criteria Matrix
* Evaluate potential options against a list of weighted factors


Frictionless distribution — what an app is launched

Survey users to see what the demand is (get feedback)
Is this helpful? Will people want to use this?

Roadblocks (iterate on wireframes i.e. each single app look)

One of the pain points would be for asylum status
Can you actually get up-to-date personal asylum status?
