      <h1 class="name">Abbas Haidari</h1>
      <h1 class="location"> 🇦🇫 → 🇵🇰 → 🇦🇫 → 🇬🇷 → 🇳🇴</h1>
      <p class="text">Abbas has been on the run since he was six months old.
      He was born in the Jaghori district, Ghazni province in
      Afghanistan, but he has lived most of his life in exile in
      Pakistan and Iran. His family fled to Pakistan when he was six
      months old. Since they were living there illegally, however,
      they were deported back to Afghanistan in 2009. Abbas has never
      forgotten the bus ride back: they were detained by the Taliban,
      who arrests families from his Hazara ethnic group. While in
      Taliban captivity they were abused and separated. Abbas and his
      mother were separated from his father and brother. This was the
      last time Abbas would see his father, and he still doesn’t know
      where he is or if he is still alive to this day. He reunited
      with his brother in Norway where they have been living for the
      last eight years. Having picked up many languages on his
      journey, Abbas often works as a translator, and helps young
      refugees integrate in Norway.

          <h1 class="location"> 🇦🇫 → 🇬🇷 → 🇳🇴</h1>
          <p class="text">Abbas is from Kabul, Afghanistan and is now
            living in Norway. he traveled to Greece as an unaccompanied minor
            and learned to speak seven languages without any formal education.
            His father was murdered while Abbas was making the journey. Abbas
            wants to figure out a way to bring hot water into camps. After
            witnessing mothers who had to bathe their children in ice-cold water
            during winter on the islands, he MacGyvered a solution to heat water
            using electrical wires. He believes there could be a solar-powered
            solution to heating the readily available water on the islands that
            house refugees.</p>
